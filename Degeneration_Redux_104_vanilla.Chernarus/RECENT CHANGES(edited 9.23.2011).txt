/*Dominic:
New Horde Param. Change whether you want the zombies to FUCK YOU UP or not.
Added "this setVariable ["victim",objNull,true];" to all the survivors. Not sure what it does but it's in Celery's missions for the players.
Fixed up the BLUfor pilot spawn after the wait time.
*\

/*Craig:
Added Vehicle spawn in map screen by server only.Not noticeable by players.Vehicles are there when you enter game. Can be found in preload.sqf script
Deleted vehicles spawn script, redundant.
*/


/*Dominic:08/21/2011
Removed Horde Param! Might have been issue.
Removed the init line from the players. "this setVariable ["victim",objNull,true];"

*/


/*Dominic:08/22/2011
Added "_car addAction ["Attach Vehicle", "attachVehicle.sqf", [], 1, false, true, "", "driver _target == player"];" to preload.sqf. Which gives the option for most vehicles to tow static weapons.
Removed _horde=true. Going to try Aggro range to see if it presents enough of a challenge. (Trying to make it so players can stake out an area if necessary without constant zombies 100% of the time)
Increased horde spawn time, just a tad. (5 minutes flat)
Increased horde spawn count. (30-50 zombies)
Increased Horde spawn radius
Random Gear Cache completed. Should be optimized to best of ability :O
*\


/*Craig:08/23/2011
NOTE: the 5.1 version on the server does not include the following changes.
Changed the hints in the onplayerconnect.sqf to sidechat messages
Added a very small chance of a special vehicle spawning: armored minigun suv, m2a3, stryker, or LAV25
Added a 75 percent chance of an aa12 spawning in the special vehicle
Spent an hour searching for a nonexistant ammo dump at the north airfield with dan
*/

/*Dominic:08/24/2011
Static Weapon Cache completeed
Gear Cache completed/fixed
Added Join Group commands to all BLUfor on the map.
Added random BLUfor groups. WATCH OUT FOR FF!! AHH!!!
Added the ability to access helicopter! Must  find all 5 ZU cannons (Temporary)
*\


/*Craig:08/25/2011
Continuted on the cararray from yesterday. Added publicVariable "cararray"; so that cararray is synced on jip. 
Untested*
*/


/*Dominic:08/25/2011
Tested car's didn't seem to work for dedicated :|. I couldn't even get the script to work for NON-jip players even. I'm failing. Can't get the damn action to stick.
*\

/*Dominic:08/27/2011
Thanks to Garret and Craig the Vehicle towing scripts have been implemented. They should be JIP compatibile as well! We just need to do some play testing. We are close to being done as well.
We will just need to tweak a couple of things (Such as weapon spawns/special vehicle spawn types). Any cool ideas can be implemented as well as long as it's just updated hur in this txt
file. I would like to have a few sidemissions as well. (Sidemissions give players options as to what reward they want? A special vehicle, Truck with an ammo crate in the back,(Unique items)
Added files to init.sqf
afterinit.sqf
*\


/*Dominic:08/31/2011
Updated a few scripts. Added in a new script called "ZombieTest.sqf". For now it just spawns a random # (large) Horde of zombies in the middle of the map that will track the players 
down eventually. I fixed the fires not appearing on Helicopter parts (So they are easier to spot now. Yay!) and created a marker that will show the location of ONE Helicopter Part.
That way the players know what they are looking for.
This all needs dedicated server testing. It all worked correctly in lan.
Also removed all BLUfor in the map. Way too much friendly fire. The thing about friendly fire, is that it isn't.
*\

/*Dominic:09/1/2011
UNTESTED/ADDED: Attempted to fix bug with players not seeing tow actions until they rejoin. (Commented addaction lines and moved them to the preload script)
ADDED/PARTIALLYTESTED: Added the "Objective.sqf" to the Afterinit.sqs script (At bottom). This should monitor the ZU cannons and their locations to the Heli.
CHANGED: Changed the horde spawn time from 10 minutes to every 15 minutes (Keep in mind the max # of zombies in play is roughly 432)
ADDED/UNTESTED: Created "PartLocation.sqf". When the players are within 150 Meters of one of the "Helicopter Parts" 
it will change the intensity of the fire to 0. Eliminating some lag/uncessary rendering. It should also
re-add the fire effect (to an intensity of 4.5) once the players leave the 150M distance. It gets checked
every 10 seconds. ***Worried that it might created infinite fires on an object? Only LAG will tell!
FIXED: One of the towing scripts would run the wrong script. Should be corrected now. 
FIXED: The Addaction's for the Towing scripts suddenly having the same name so the players wouldn't know which action did what.
ADDED: (THANKS TO GARRET) The Food/Water System!WOOO!!!!!
ADDED: (THANKS TO GARRET) Addon for Food/Water icons and Helicopter Parts
*\


/*Dominic:09/4/2011
ADDED/CHANGED: Garret fixed up the addon/added classes and etc.
CHANGED: Vehicles can now tow 9999 items (Thanks to Garret)
Fixed: Helicopter system is now working.
New: You can fly to the very East to end the game. (Or swim?)
Changed: A bunch of stuff...Uh...can't recall all. :|
*\



/*Dominic:09/16/2011
CHANGED: Zombie Horde Script lowered from 15 minutes to 10. Changed it so it will spawn a flat 30 zombies and then a random 5 armored zombies
CHANGED: Drop loot from zombies
CHANGED: Debug mode to work properly in MP
CHANGED: Spawn radius for vehicles increased by 150 M
*\


/*Dominic:09/18/2011
ADDED: Health Bar.
ADDED: Water Bar.
ADDED: Food Bar (By Garret).
CHANGED: Bandage drop rate increased to 10%
ADDED: Added a "Food Stash"
CHANGED: Increased chance of food/water in vehicles. (Made it so there will ALWAYS be at least 1 bread/water when the script it called)
*\

/*Dominic:09/19/2011
FIXED: Health/Food/Water bar HOPEFULLY are setup correctly... Probably not though :|
*/


/*Dominic:09/23/2011
FIXED: Locality issues with Food/Water bars and timers.
ADDED: Another Easter Egg
